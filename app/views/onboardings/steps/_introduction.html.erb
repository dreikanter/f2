<h1 class="card-title mb-4">Welcome to Feeder</h1>

<p class="lead mb-4">
  Feeder automatically reposts content from RSS, Atom, and other sources to your FreeFeed groups.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
  To get things running, you'll need to:
</p>

<ul class="mb-4">
  <li>Connect your FreeFeed account with an API token</li>
  <li>Add a feed to monitor</li>
  <li>Pick which FreeFeed groups to post to</li>
  <li>Choose how often to check for new content</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-4">
  No need to remember, we'll walk you through.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
  But if you'd rather explore on your own, skip setup and configure everything manually. You can always come back later.
</p>
