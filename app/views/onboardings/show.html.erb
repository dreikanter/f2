          Feeder automatically reposts content from RSS, Atom, and other sources to your FreeFeed groups.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          To get things running, you'll need to:
        </p>

        <ul class="mb-4">
          <li>Connect your FreeFeed account with an API token</li>
          <li>Add a feed to monitor</li>
          <li>Pick which FreeFeed groups to post to</li>
          <li>Choose how often to check for new content</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mb-4">
          No need to remember, we'll walk you through.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          But if you'd rather explore on your own, skip ahead and set up things up manually. You can always restrat the onboarding later.
        </p>
