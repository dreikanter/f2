Hi,

Someone requested a password reset for your account. If that was you, click the link below to set a new password:

<%= edit_password_url(@user.password_reset_token) %>

This link will expire in <%= distance_of_time_in_words(Time.current, User::PASSWORD_RESET_TTL.from_now) %> for security reasons.

If you didn't request this, you can safely ignore this email. Your password won't change.
